# DrumKitWebsite
simple website displaying different song of a drumKit

The purpose of this personnal project was to understand javascript with deeper concepts than variables and array, I learned the concept of callback function, learned to interact with the webage with DOM. Learn to use anonymous function.

The project display 7 different images of a part of a drumKit, on these images we can see some letters, the user have the choice of pressing the images with his mouse or with the keyboard.Both of these events are tracked with javascript and when one of these events happend, the song corresponding to the image is displayed and we have a little animation effect on the image that the user selected.
